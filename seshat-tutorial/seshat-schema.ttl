  rdfs:comment "A polity is defined as an independent political unit. Kinds of polities range from villages (local communities) through simple and complex chiefdoms to states and empires. A polity can be either centralized or not (e.g., organized as a confederation). What distinguishes a polity from other human groupings and organizations is that it is politically independent of any overarching authority; it possesses sovereignty. Polities are defined spatially by the area enclosed within a boundary on the world map. There may be more than one such areas. Polities are dynamical entities, and thus their geographical extent may change with time. Thus, typically each polity will be defined by a set of multiple boundaries, each for a specified period of time. For prehistoric periods and for areas populated by a multitude of small-scale polities we use a variant called quasi-polity."@en ;

scm:QuasiPolity
  a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "The polity-based approach is not feasible for those periods when a region is divided up among a multitude of small-scale polities (e.g., independent villages or even many small chiefdoms). In this instance we use the concept of 'quasi-polity'. Similarly, for societies known only archaeologically we may not be able to establish the boundaries of polities, even approximately. Quasi-polity is defined as a cultural area with some degree of cultural homogeneity (including linguistic, if known) that is distinct from surrounding areas. For example, the Marshall Islands before German occupation had no overarching native or colonial authority (chiefs controlled various subsets of islands and atolls) and therefore it was not a polity. But it was a quasi-polity because of the significant cultural and linguistic uniformity.<P>We collect data for the quasi-polity as a whole. This way we can integrate over (often patchy) data from different sites and different polities to estimate what the 'generic' social and political system was like. Data is not entered for the whole region but for a 'typical' polity in it. For example, when coding a quasi-polity, its territory is not the area of the region as a whole, but the average or typical area of autonomous groups within the NGA."@en ;

Archaeologists often use 'archaeological traditions' to denote such large-scale cultural entities (for example, Peregrine's Atlas of Cultural Evolution). Note, 'supracultural entity' refers to cultural interdependence, and is distinct from a political confederation or alliance, which should be coded under 'supra-polity relations.'."@en ;
